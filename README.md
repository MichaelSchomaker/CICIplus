## Whatâ€™s `CICIplus`?

The `CICIplus` R package is an extension of the `CICI` package, which is available on CRAN. It allows estimation of counterfactual outcomes for multiple values of continuous interventions at different time points, and plotting of causal dose-response curves. This extension provides an implementation of the sequential g-formula with an integration of outcome-weights to address positivity violations, see [Schomaker, McIlleron, Denti, Diaz, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06645) for details. At a later stage the functions from `CICIplus` will be integrated into `CICI` .
